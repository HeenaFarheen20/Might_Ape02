Visualizing RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) data can provide valuable insights into customer behavior and segmentation.
Here are some steps you can taken for RFM data:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Ensure your RFM data is clean and structured properly. Each customer should have RFM values associated with them.

2. **Data Analysis**: Before visualizing, segment your customers based on their RFM scores.
    This segmentation can be done using Order Date, Order Number and total Order value.
   Assign labels to each segment, such as "Recency Score," "Frequency Score," "Monetary Score," etc.
