#--Suggestions---
1. Through this analysis, the company will be able to identify which customers are their long-term customers
and which customers are one-time buyers.
2. Through this analysis, the company will send advertisements, messages, emails related to products,
and offer discounts to customers to engage them more in online shopping.
